  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Foundry">Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)</a> is a cloud-native application
  platform that simplifies the process of building, testing, deploying, and scaling applications. It supports continuous
  delivery, allowing developers to deliver applications faster with higher productivity. PCF is known for its robust
  security features, self-healing capabilities, and high availability. However, it was complex to setup and maintain.
  Additionally, the licensing costs was very high.

  In 2018, the company decided to replace PCF with Kubernetes (k8s). at that time I was already working on a
  side-project utilizing <a href="https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/">CF API</a> to capture inventory data. so I knew
  some automation can be done. once I shared my work with my manager, he started digging further into how far we can
  take this. It didn't take long time before realizing that we can automate almost the entire migration process!

  A migration tool is built using .NET to automate the migration. main steps performed on each space:
  <ul>
    <li>collect all resources metadata</li>
    <li>download PCF droplets which contains the app binary files</li>
    <li>generate dockerfile based on the app buildpack (.NET, Java, static, ..etc)</li>
    <li>build and push the docker image using the new dockerfile and binary artifact from droplet</li>
    <li>capture apps secrets and replicate them to HashiCorp Vault</li>
    <li>capture apps environment variables and replicate</li>
    <li>generate and upload Helm chart with app variables and secrets key paths</li>
    <li>deploy helm chart to k8s cluster for testing and validation</li>
  </ul>

  The migration tool reduced migration time from weeks to minutes per application. Additionally, reduced the Kubernetes
  learning curve for development teams.
