How many times you got an error message on Windows and you want to do online search but you can not copy the text ?
This happens a lot to me and I wanted to save my time from re-typing the text on online search engines.
I couldn't find free solutions at that time so I decided to build my own.

Grabtxt is a simple utility that enables you to capture the text portions from many Windows dialog boxes.
The captured text can be copied to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) or used to search for details via google or ping.
