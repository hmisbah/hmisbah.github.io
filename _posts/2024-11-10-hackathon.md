I am thrilled to share the journey of my team’s participation and wining first prize in a recent hackathon at work.

## The Challenge

Our winning idea centered around automating and simplifying the onboarding process for a major platform. Access to this platform is governed by around 300 Active Directory (AD) Groups, making it a daunting task to determine the correct AD roles for onboarding new users. Recognizing this pain point, we set out to develop a solution that would streamline and automate this process.

## The Solution

We successfully delivered a production-ready solution that wowed the judges and set us apart from other teams. What truly impressed the judges was our approach: rather than introducing a new application, we ingeniously leveraged three existing platforms:

-  **Workflow Orchestration Platform**: This served as our backend, allowing us to execute custom code efficiently.

-  **Digital Forms Platform**: This acted as our frontend, providing a seamless user interface for input and interactions.

-  **Notification Platform**: We used this to send automated emails based on HTML templates, ensuring clear and timely communication.

By integrating these platforms, we created a cohesive and efficient solution that not only simplified the onboarding process but also utilized resources already available within our organization.

## The Experience

Participating in the hackathon was an incredible experience. It provided a unique opportunity to connect and collaborate closely with members of my department and business unit. We were able to explore new technologies and methodologies outside our usual focus areas, broadening our horizons and enhancing our skillsets.

The hackathon also opened the door to implementing various other solutions based on the existing workflow orchestration platform. This experience has truly been a game-changer, allowing us to see the potential for innovation within the platforms we already have.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the hackathon was not just about winning—it was about learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible. I encourage everyone to participate in such events, as they offer invaluable experiences and the chance to drive meaningful change within your organization.
