Most clients communicate with us using emails to report bugs or request new features.  
We then manually fill in the same information on Jira.  
I wanted to solve this problem and automate this process to save time so I built this addon.  
 
This addon is used to create/edit issues directly from MS Outlook and it support adding attachments.<br /><br />
