Today I finished another exciting training course from AWS.  
**[AWS Cloud Financial Management for Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/aws-cloud-financial-management-for-builders)** course is for individuals who seek an understanding of how to manage, optimize, and estimate costs as you run workloads on AWS. You will learn how to implement architectural best practices, explore cost-optimization strategies, and design patterns to help you architect cost-efficient solutions on AWS.

I highley recommend this training course for AWS solution architect and builders.
