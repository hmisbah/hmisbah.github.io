<p>
My company uses a solution from <a href="https://www.tempo.io/products/jira-time-tracking"> tempo.io </a> to manage and track timesheets within Jira. Users are asked to log the time spent on each Jira issue.
While this is an annoying manual task for engineers like me, it is very valuable for the company to gather this information 
to help track progress, cost and productivity across teams and products.

I wanted to solve this problem and reduce the time I spend filling my timesheet. 
After some thinking I realized that most of my working hours are either spent working on Jira issues or attending meetings.
Almost all meetings are scheduled on Outlook so I know for sure when and how long is each meeting. so I just need to replicate this information to my Jira timesheet.
So I created an addon on Microsoft Outlook to automate this process for me. This can save each user at least an hour per month.
