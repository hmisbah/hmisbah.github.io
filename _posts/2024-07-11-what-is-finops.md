## What is FinOps
FinOps is a blend of "Finance" and "DevOps," is an operational framework and cultural practice that maximizes the business value of cloud computing. It promotes collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams to ensure financial accountability and data-driven decision-making.  
  
## Why FinOps Matters
In today's digital landscape, cloud spending is a significant operational expense for many organizations. Without proper management, this spending can quickly spiral out of control, leading to wasted resources and increased costs. FinOps helps organizations gain visibility into their cloud spending, optimize resource usage, and align cloud investments with business goals.
