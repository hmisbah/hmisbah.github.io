Today I completed **[Architecting on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/architecting-on-aws/)** course.  
AWS is the most cloud service provider used in my organization and it is important for me to gain advanced knowledge in AWS to be able to build better solutions myself and to provide best support for all developmenmt squads. Having skills in both Architecture and DevOps will allow me to help development squads at all stages of the software development lifecycle. 

This course will help you learn to identify services and features to build resilient, secure, and highly available IT solutions in the AWS Cloud. Expert AWS Instructors emphasize best practices using the AWS Well-Architected Framework and guide you through the process of designing optimal IT solutions, based on real-life scenarios. At the end of the course, you’ll practice building a solution and apply what you’ve learned with confidence.
